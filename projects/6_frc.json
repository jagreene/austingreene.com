    "text": "I was the team captain and programming lead for my local FIRST Robotics team, 'The Raging Sea-Biscuits' from 2010 to 2013. Our robots were programmed in C++ with effective autonomous and user controlled modes. Robots had a range of features including playing a modified version of ultimate frisbee and basketball as well as shooting off miniature robots and balancing on bridges. I have continued to serve as a programming mentor for my team while studying at Olin",
