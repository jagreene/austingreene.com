    "text": "Emotcha is a proof of concept for a captcha alternative I developed for a devpost hackathon, Reinvent the Selfie. Conventional captcha's try and separate humans from robots using hard to read squigliy text; Emotcha uses a truely human charateristic, emotions, to find humans. It works by showing users a picture of a persons face and live feed of their own face from their webcam. Users must then try and match their emotions to the emotions of the example to unlock a mock login dialogue. This project won both the All you can EaaS prize and Twilio Grand Prize.",
