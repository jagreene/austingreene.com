    "text": "I was an engineering intern at Synthego the summer of 2014. While there I designed and integrated novel automated instruments for a robotic bio-tech pipeline. I worked on both the mechanical design of real products as well as programming them to work as part of a larger ecosystem. The mechanical design was primarily done in solidworks while programming was done in python.",
