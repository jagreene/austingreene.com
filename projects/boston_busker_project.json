    "text": "The Boston Busker Project is the culmination of a semester long course in user oriented collaborative design. Our goal was to try and design a product that would dramatically change the lives of street performers in the Boston area. In the end we designed a competition by which local architectural designers could create stages for performers through out the city. These stages would not only enhance the beauty of the city but also legitimize and elevate being a busker in Boston.",
